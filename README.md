# PedestrianTrafficLightDetectorRaspberryPi
These are the program files for my pedestrian traffic light detector project.
It follows the standard TensorFlow format on the Raspberry Pi.
To run my program, first set up TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi. For a tutorial, see here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npZ-8Nj1YwY. After, all you have to do is download my files and run Object_detection_webcam.py

The actual program is found at
